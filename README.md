# Reservation App

In this app you can reserve some transport for some time.
The idea was to create user friendly interface which is simple and practical  

Things I used in this application :

* Ruby 3.1.2p20, Rails 7.0.4, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

* Scaffold

* Bootstrap

* Sqlite3

* HeidiSQL, RubyMine, Linux terminal in Windows

To run applications you need to download the repository and using Linux or Mac terminal write in

rails s
